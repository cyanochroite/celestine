By default this is a command line application. Should work anywhere Python 3 code can be run. The code has several folders dedicated to specific pluggins. If package not found, code not run. Can actually be deleted if desired.



Requirements:
Python


Recomended
Python 3.4 (Lib/base64.py)
Python 3.9 (PEP 584)

Pillow 7.2.0 (TIFF BYTE tags format)
Replaced TiffImagePlugin DEBUG with logging
Corrected default offset when writing EXIF data
Moved to ImageFileDirectory_v2 in Image.Exif
TIFF BYTE tags format



Recommended Packages:
Tkinter: Included in most python distributions, which means no installation or setup required. Adds GUI to application. Makes it easier for the average user to use. (Plus now you can actually see the images.)

Pillow: InstaLibrary for loading images. Allows for many image file types.


Optional Packages:
-None-
Additional GUI libraries and features may be added in the future. Some configuration may be needed to toggle these additional features.

Rexex parser: Adds support for wildcard searches using '*'.
