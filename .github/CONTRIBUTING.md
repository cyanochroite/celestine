Helpful things:
Biggest help would be someone who speaks or types in a different language other then English. If the program does not work on your computer or in your language or regions, thatâ€™s a bug! Identifying or fixing these problems are the biggest concern right now.

Things that are unhelpful:
Fixes for spelling, grammar, code style, code formatting. Maybe later, but for now the code is way too volatile to care about such irrelevant things.
