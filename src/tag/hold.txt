I believe that record is held by the codepoint U+FBF9 (ÔØπ), ‚ÄúARABIC LIGATURE UIGHUR KIRGHIZ YEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE WITH ALEF MAKSURA ISOLATED FORM,‚Äù which is 83 characters. There are a couple of other Arabic ligatures that are close to that count, as well.
The next longest name for a different sort of character is U+1F502 (üîÇ), ‚ÄúCLOCKWISE RIGHTWARDS AND LEFTWARDS OPEN CIRCLE ARROWS WITH CIRCLED ONE OVERLAY‚Äù which is 78 characters.
