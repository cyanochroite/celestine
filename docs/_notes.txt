I believe that record is held by the codepoint U+FBF9 (ﯹ), “ARABIC LIGATURE UIGHUR KIRGHIZ YEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE WITH ALEF MAKSURA ISOLATED FORM,” which is 83 characters. There are a couple of other Arabic ligatures that are close to that count, as well.
The next longest name for a different sort of character is U+1F502 (🔂), “CLOCKWISE RIGHTWARDS AND LEFTWARDS OPEN CIRCLE ARROWS WITH CIRCLED ONE OVERLAY” which is 78 characters.

does white space matter?
no

steps
0 user input
1 strip out all illegal characters. pass over each character and move to new buffer if valid
>2 convert invalid characters to valid character in new buffer
3 remove all whitespace. separate items to token groups
4 apply found symbols to new class. when hit tag, previously applied attributes are used. otherwise defaults used. state set each time new symbol seen, so in essence, last one seen used

ALL 	All levels including custom levels.
DEBUG 	Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.
INFO 	Designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.
WARN 	Designates potentially harmful situations.
ERROR 	Designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
FATAL 	Designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
OFF 	The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
TRACE 	Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.
